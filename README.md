## About
Most cryptoeconomic policies today (e.g. inflation rate, burning rate) are either coded statically or rely on DAO governance for adjustments. 
This approach ensures decentralization, but the lack of real-time response mechanisms also make the tokenomics vulnerable to the impact of external shocks, such as a large price movements and hacks.  

How do we design tokenomics that is robust against these shocks, while preserving decentralization? The bold yet rational answer is: let a bot run the economy.  

In this research project, my aim is to build an autonomous algorithm that regulates a blockchain economy with two key parameters: staking rate and burning rate. 
In particular, I apply a modeling tool from modern macroeconomic theory called DSGE, which is the gold standard used by central banks worldwide to determine key economic parameters like interest rates. 
Cutting-edge data science tools such as machine learning and causal inference models will be applied in the calibration process. 
This research aims to provide guidance for the new generation of protocol tokenomics.

This is my ongoing M.A. thesis research which will go under the review of University of Chicago Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics.
